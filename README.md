# [Veusz 4.1](https://veusz.github.io/)

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by combining
plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple, consistent and
powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 4.1:
  * Much improved icons for dark mode
  * Provide preference for forcing dark/light mode or setting other
    color themes (includes breeze light and dark)
  * Provide portable zip executable for Windows
  * Add WebP export image format
  * Provide 600 DPI in list in export dialog
  * Bug fixes
     * Fix for formatting dock when deleting widgets (korintje)
     * Bind icon to desktop file on Wayland (antohami)
     * Fix for dual monitors under Wayland
     * Disable export formats if not supported by built Qt
     * Add missing TIF image format in binaries

Changes in 4.0:
  * Update to using Qt6 (jeremysanders/korintje)
  * Documentation updates
  * Copying SVG or image widgets copies image data (from slowphil)
  * Bug fixes:
     * HDF5 import
     * 3D rotation
     * Swap attributes for 2D data if transposing
     * Hide stderr from embedded usage unless debug=True
     * Fix histogram2d fro normed to density
     * Fix for datasets of different lengths if using gap_handling='ignore'
     * Rename nan\_handling to gap\_handling
     * Continue loading if error in plugins
     * Fix overlapping formatting dock on Mac (korintje)
  * Binaries now built using GitHub actions
