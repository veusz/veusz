# [Veusz 3.6.1](https://veusz.github.io/)

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by combining
plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple, consistent and
powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 3.6.1:
  * Fix appdata file
  * Fix issue in setup.cfg

Changes in 3.6:
  * Interactive rotation of 3D plots
  * Add 12-bit rainbow colormap
  * Fix crash in contour key values
  * Fix breakage with recent numpy versions due to removal of bool
  * Fix error in colormap sequence
  * About dialog shows software versions
  * Rewrite install instructions in INSTALL.md
  * Fix for Python 3.11 due to opening with universal newlines
  * Remove use of distutils
  * Fix MacOS binary
