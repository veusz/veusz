    <p>
      Veusz is an interactive graphical scientific plotting and
      graphing package. It is designed to produce publication-ready
      PDF output. SVG, EMF and bitmap export formats are also
      supported. Data can be read from text, CSV, HDF5 or FITS
      files. In addition, you can also enter, manipulate or examine
      data from within the application.  The program also provides a
      command line and scripting interface (based on Python) to its
      plotting facilities. It can also act as a Python plotting
      module.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Veusz plots are created by building up plotting widgets with
      a consistent object-based interface. Plotting types support by
      Veusz include the following: x-y, function, contour, image,
      stepped, date, vector field, box, polar, ternary, nested and
      stacked. Plots can also include multiple axes.
