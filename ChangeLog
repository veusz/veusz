   delete or unlink all associated datasets
 * New tree-like dataset browsing widget is shown in data edit dialog
 * Importing 1D fits images is now supported
 * Date / time data has its own dataset type
 * The data edit dialog box can create or edit date/time data in
   human-readable form

Minor improvements:
 * Add LaTeX commands \cdot, \nabla, \overline plus some arrows
 * Inform user in exception dialog if a new version is available
 * Add linevertbar and linehorzbar error bar styles

Bug fixes:
 * Fix crash on filling filled error regions if no error bars
 * Remove grouping separator to numbers in locale as it creates
   ambiguous lists of numbers
