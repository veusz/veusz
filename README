Veusz 3.1
---------
https://veusz.github.io

Veusz is a 2D and 3D scientific plotting package.  It is designed to
produce publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by
combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 3.1:
 * Change in build system to use qmake to find Qt locations. This is to fix
   the build inside Anaconda. Also Qt and sip parameters can now be given
   as environment variables.
 * Fix problem when picking points with too many non-finite values
 * Change default SVG export DPI to 96 to match inkscape and provide
   option in dialog to choose export DPI
 * Allow %PAGE% and %PAGENAME% in export filename for single page output
 * Fix failing fitting due to iminuit differences
 * Fix crash if both ends of part of broken axis widget are the same for
   EMF exporting

Features of package:
 Plotting features:
  * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
  * Line and function plots
  * Contour plots
  * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
  * Stepped plots (for histograms)
  * Bar graphs
  * Vector field plots
  * Box plots
  * Polar plots
  * Ternary plots
  * Plotting dates
  * Fitting functions to data
  * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
  * Nested plots
  * Plot keys
  * Plot labels
  * Shapes and arrows on plots
  * LaTeX-like formatting for text
  * Multiple axes
  * Axes with steps in axis scale (broken axes)
  * Axis scales using functional forms
  * Plotting functions of datasets
  * 3D point plots
  * 3D surface plots
  * 3D function plots
  * 3D volumetric plots
 Input and output:
  * PDF/EPS/PNG/SVG/EMF export
  * Dataset creation/manipulation
  * Embed Veusz within other programs
  * Text, HDF5, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
  * Data can be captured from external sources
 Extending:
  * Use as a Python module
  * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
  * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface
  * Control with DBUS and SAMP
 Other features:
  * Data filtering and manipulation
  * Data picker
  * Interactive tutorial
  * Multithreaded rendering
