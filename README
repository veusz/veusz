Veusz is a scientific plotting package written in Python (currently
100% Python). It uses PyQt for display and user-interfaces, and
numarray for handling the numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript output.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line and scripting interface (based on
Python) to its plotting facilities. The plots are built using an
object-based system to provide a consistent interface.

Changes from 0.6:
 Please refer to ChangeLog for all the changes.
 Highlights include:
  * 2D image support

  * Support for line separated blocks of data when importing
  * Reversed axes supported
  * Key length option
  * Linked dataset reload UI
  * Plot functions over specific range
  * Several UI improvements 

Features of package:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Images (with colour mappings)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
 * Line plots
 * Function plots
 * Fitting functions to data
 * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
 * Plot keys
 * Plot labels
 * LaTeX-like formatting for text
 * EPS output

If you enjoy using Veusz, I would love to hear from you. Please join
the mailing lists at

to discuss new features or if you'd like to contribute code. The
newest code can always be found in CVS.

If non GPL projects are interested in using Veusz code, please contact
me. I am happy to consider relicencing code for other free projects,
if I am legally allowed to do so.

Cheers
