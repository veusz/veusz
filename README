Veusz 1.23
----------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript, PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up
by combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.23:
 * Add new export dialog box which can export multiple pages and
   modify the export options
 * Add cubehelix() functional colormap
 * Add -stepN suffix for colormaps to make arbitrary numbers of steps
 * Fix incorrect colors in log images and log color scales
 * Fix unsafe commands not being run

Minor changes
 * Fix incorrect use of None in (x,...) pattern
 * Catch crash if plotting nan/inf value in log space
 * Fix getData in dataset plugin for dimensions=2
 * Catch error in too large float to date time conversion
 * Catch disappeared file during import
 * Index error fixed in pickable
 * Catch error in data edit dialog if 2d dataset size changes
 * If root widget is selected with others, do not error on hide
 * Fix undo for dataset histogram with a single output dataset
 * Fix error resizing ellipse with a tuple width, height or position setting
 * Only use finite values in histogram
 * Rewrite Line/FillSet setting controls for internal consistency and to fix
   new style extended fills
 * Do not crash with log date-time axes
 * Also ignore non-finite values when fitting with minuit
 * Avoid syntax error with invalid colormap
 * Updates to setup.py and desktop files
 * Recreate dataset now works if dialog hasn't been opened already
 * Restore dock layout when using Python3

Issues with the current version:

  * Due to a bug in the Qt XML processing, some MathML elements
    containing purely white space (e.g. thin space) will give an error.
