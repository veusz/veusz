Veusz 1.19.1
------------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. Graphs are built-up by
combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.19.1:
 * Add option to disable scaling of marker border with point scaling

Bug fixes:
 * Fix broken drag and drop in documents
 * Fix deleted C/C++ object crash when using undo and in tutorial
 * Fix compilation in MSVC for Python 3
 * Remove warning/error in compilation in gcc in SUSE
 * Add Python version classifiers
 * Fix document icons in Windows binary

Changes in 1.19:
 * Make code compatible with python3
 * Separation of python module and resources in source package
   (packagers may need to consult INSTALL)
 * Move to v2 of PyQt API
 * Remove deprecated numpy API from helpers module
 * Allow FITS dataset names to be blank if prefix/suffix are not
 * New ast-based code security checker
 * Picker uses 1-based index for consistency
 * Allow non-text datasets to be used for labels
 * Add number->text conversion dataset plugin
 * Add binning dataset plugin
 * Allow more significant figures in float values
 * Intelligent choice of significant figures when interactively
   changing axis range
 * Decrease minimum range of axis
 * Add notes setting to document, pages and graphs

Bug fixes:
 * Fix crash if other linked axis not initialized
 * Fix crash if trying to edit non-editable datasets
 * Make ignore exception work in error reporting dialog
 * Renaming datasets, widgets and editing data now allow original
   text to be edited, rather than being cleared
 * Fix line positions on broken axes
 * OS X Mavericks - fixes for opening files from finder and fonts
