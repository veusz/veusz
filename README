Veusz 1.18
----------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. Graphs are built-up by
combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.18:
 * Add axis-function widget for plotting axes which have a scale given
   by a function, or are linked to a different axis via a function
 * Add colour maps with steps
 * Allow editing multiple datasets simultaneously in editor
 * Fixed aspect-ratio for graphs setting added
 * Add 'vcentre' line step mode for vertical step plots
 * Expressions of datasets can be used for plotting

Bug fixes:
 * Fix reversed 'broken'-axes
 * Do not always draw axes above other widgets (fixes problem with key
   below axis)
 * Fix use of transparency image when plotting non-square images
 * Allow lists passed as xrange and yrange to create 2D dataset
 * Fix FieldBool positioning for plugins
 * Fix "no" values when used mixed with numbers

Features of package:
 Plotting features:
  * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
  * Line and function plots
  * Contour plots
  * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
  * Stepped plots (for histograms)
  * Bar graphs
  * Vector field plots
  * Box plots
  * Polar plots
  * Ternary plots
  * Plotting dates
  * Fitting functions to data
  * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
  * Plot keys
  * Plot labels
  * Shapes and arrows on plots
  * LaTeX-like formatting for text
  * Axes with steps in axis scale (broken axes)
  * Axis scales using functional forms
 Input and output:
  * EPS/PDF/PNG/SVG/EMF export
  * Dataset creation/manipulation
  * Embed Veusz within other programs
  * Text, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
  * Data can be captured from external sources
 Extending:
  * Use as a Python module
  * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
  * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface
  * Control with DBUS and SAMP
 Other features:
  * Data picker
  * Interactive tutorial
  * Multithreaded rendering
