Veusz 1.20.1
------------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript, PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up
by combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.20.1:
 * Include free-desktop appdata, MIME and desktop files
 * When plotting xy widget filled error regions, plot line on top

Bug fixes:
 * Fix embedding interface startup problem in 1.20
 * Additional embedding interface fixes for Python 3
 * Fix crash in tutorial if flashing widget deleted
 * Fix polar plot crash with reverse minumum and maximum radii
 * Fix crash when changing range of broken axes interactively
 * Fix object deletion crash in setting menu
 * Check output dataset is not same as an input for histograms
 * Fix for compilation on Qt 4.6
 * Catch socket errors on embed client

Changes in 1.20:
 * Add HDF5 file data import
 * Allow expressions to be edited for linked 2D datasets
 * Add support for 2D datasets with irregular gridpoints
 * Add 2D data CSV import
 * Allow safe renaming of linked datasets
 * Support importing text from FITS files

Bug fixes:
 * When capturing data from a file/named pipe, do not stop when no
   more data are available
 * Fixes mangling of text in saved files using Windows binary
 * Fix encoding for standard file import
 * Fix FITS import for python3

  * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface
  * Control with DBUS and SAMP
 Other features:
  * Data picker
  * Interactive tutorial
  * Multithreaded rendering
