Veusz is Copyright (C) 2003-2009 Jeremy Sanders <jeremy@jeremysanders.net>
Licenced under the GPL (version 2 or greater).

Veusz is a Qt4 based scientific plotting package. It is written in
Python, using PyQt4 for display and user-interfaces, and numpy for
handling the numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF output. The user interface aims to be
simple, consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets.

Changes in 1.4:
 * Dates can be plotted on axes
 * Bar graph component, support bars in groups and stacked bars
   with error bars
 * Improved import
   - text lines can be ignored in imported files
   - prefix and suffix can be added to dataset names
   - more robust import dialog
 * Markers can be "thinned" for large datasets
 * Further LaTeX support, including \frac for fractions and \\
   for line breaks.
 * Keys show error bars on datasets with errors
 * Axes can scale plotted data by a factor

More minor changes
 * Mathematical expressions can be entered in many places where
   numbers are entered (e.g. axis minima)
 * Many more latex symbols
 * Text labels can also be placed outside graphs directly on pages
 * Dataset expressions can be edited
 * Data can be copied out of data edit dialog. Rows can be inserted or
   deleted.
 * Mac format line terminators are allowed in import files
 * Preview window resizes properly in import dialog

Features of package:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Line and function plots
 * Contour plots
 * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
 * Bar graphs
 * Plotting dates
 * Fitting functions to data
 * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
 * Plot keys
 * Plot labels
 * Shapes and arrows on plots
 * LaTeX-like formatting for text
 * EPS/PDF/PNG/SVG export
 * Scripting interface
 * Dataset creation/manipulation
 * Embed Veusz within other programs
 * Text, CSV and FITS importing

Requirements:
 Python (2.4 or greater required)
   http://www.python.org/
 Qt >= 4.3 (free edition)
   http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/  
 PyQt >= 4.3 (SIP is required to be installed first)
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/
 numpy >= 1.0
   http://numpy.scipy.org/

Optional:
 Microsoft Core Fonts (recommended for nice output)
   http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/
 PyFITS >= 1.1 (optional for FITS import)
   http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits

For documentation on using Veusz, see the "Documents" directory. The
manual is in pdf, html and text format (generated from docbook).

Issues with the current version:

 * Due to Qt, hatched regions sometimes look rather poor when exported
   to PostScript or PDF.

 * Due to a bug in Qt, some long lines, or using log scales, can lead
   to very slow plot times under X11. This problem is seen with
   dashed/dotted lines. It is fixed by upgrading to Qt-4.5.1 (the
   Veusz binary version includes this Qt version).

 * Can be very slow to plot large datasets if antialiasing is enabled.
   Right click on graph and disable antialias to speed up output. This
   is mostly a problem with older Qt versions, however.

If you enjoy using Veusz, I would love to hear from you. Please join
the mailing lists at

to discuss new features or if you'd like to contribute code. The
latest code can always be found in the SVN repository.
