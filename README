Veusz is a scientific plotting package. It is written in Python, using
PyQt4 for display and user-interfaces, and numpy for handling the
numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce publication-ready
Postscript/PDF output. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets.
