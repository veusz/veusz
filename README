Veusz is a scientific plotting package written in Python, using PyQt
for display and user-interfaces, and numarray for handling the numeric
data. Veusz is designed to produce publication-ready Postscript
output. The user interface aims to be simple, consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets.
