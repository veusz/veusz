Veusz 2.1.1
-----------
https://veusz.github.io

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by combining
plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple, consistent and
powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 2.1.1:
 * Fix dashed/dotted custom lines in EMF output
 * Fix Fields in dataset plugins
 * Fix data import plugins
 * Use deprecated sipconfig if available to find SIP files
 * Fix problems with opening files using command line arguments with
   some encodings
 * Hide splash if program takes too long to start

Changes in 2.1:
 * If file cannot be imported on document load, ask user for a new filename
 * Only open HDF5 files in readonly mode
 * Do not simply log errors when loading data with ImportPlugins
 * Cleanup of stylesheet, setting and widget code
 * Fix filename chooser and embedding in ImageFile widget
 * Force C++11 compilation on Unix
 * Fix document reload, export warning and unsafe loading dialogs
 * Parameterize number of line steps in covariance widget
 * Report error line number for csv reading exceptions
 * Convert values from expressions to 1D arrays when required
 * Take account of endsize setting for bar plot error bars
 * Remove dependence on sipconfig in build and add sip build parameters

Features of package:
 Plotting features:
  * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
  * Line and function plots
  * Contour plots
  * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)

  * Shapes and arrows on plots
  * LaTeX-like formatting for text
  * Multiple axes
  * Axes with steps in axis scale (broken axes)
  * Axis scales using functional forms
  * Plotting functions of datasets
 Input and output:
  * PDF/EPS/PNG/SVG/EMF export
  * Dataset creation/manipulation
  * Embed Veusz within other programs
  * Text, HDF5, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
  * Data can be captured from external sources
 Extending:
  * Use as a Python module
  * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
  * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface
  * Control with DBUS and SAMP
 Other features:
  * Data filtering and manipulation
  * Data picker
  * Interactive tutorial
  * Multithreaded rendering
