Veusz 2.2.1
-----------
https://veusz.github.io

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by combining
plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple, consistent and
powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 2.2.1:
 * Fix mouse control for Key widget for different zoom levels
 * Correct coordinates shown on bottom of screen for different zoom levels
 * Fix zoom into graph functionality for different zoom levels
 * Fix plot picking for different zoom levels
 * When choosing a text dataset, fix the mini dataset browser
 * Fix crash when previewing in binary import using Python 3
 * Fix crash when picking points in certain circumstances

Changes in 2.2:
 * Notify user updates to Veusz are available
 * Add support for high DPI displays
 * Change zoom code scale plots, rather than changing the size of elements,
   so that plots look more similar at different zoom levels
 * Send automatic anonymous feedback to developers giving software version
   information and counts of the features used.
 * Fix colormap sequence and randomize plugins
 * Change hyphen to minus sign when using standard C formatting in tick labels
 * Fix for Chinese and Korean characters in filenames on Windows
 * Sort DatasetPlugin arguments for diffing
 * Fix bitmap EMF export in Python 3
 * The redo operation can now be done multiple times
 * Hide fully transparent objects, rather than trying to draw them
 * Fix bug report script in Python 3
 * Fallback for paint device metrics, fixing bugs when PyQt is older than Qt
 * If barplot positions setting is blank but set, treat as unset

Features of package:
 Plotting features:
  * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
  * Line and function plots
  * Contour plots
  * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
  * Stepped plots (for histograms)
  * Bar graphs
  * Vector field plots
  * Box plots
  * Polar plots

  * Shapes and arrows on plots
  * LaTeX-like formatting for text
  * Multiple axes
  * Axes with steps in axis scale (broken axes)
  * Axis scales using functional forms
  * Plotting functions of datasets
 Input and output:
  * PDF/EPS/PNG/SVG/EMF export
  * Dataset creation/manipulation
  * Embed Veusz within other programs
  * Text, HDF5, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
  * Data can be captured from external sources
 Extending:
  * Use as a Python module
  * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
  * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface
  * Control with DBUS and SAMP
 Other features:
  * Data filtering and manipulation
  * Data picker
  * Interactive tutorial
  * Multithreaded rendering
