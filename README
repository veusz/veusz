Veusz is Copyright (C) 2003-2008 Jeremy Sanders <jeremy@jeremysanders.net>
Licenced under the GPL (version 2 or greater).

Veusz is a scientific plotting package. It is written in Python, using
PyQt4 for display and user-interfaces, and numpy for handling the
numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce publication-ready
Postscript/PDF output. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets.

Change in 1.2.1:
 * Fix crash when adding a key without any key text defined.

Changes in 1.2:
 * Boxes, ellipses, lines, arrows and image files can now be added to
   the plot or page and interactively adjusted.
 * Page sizes, graphs, grids and axes can be interactively adjusted.
 * Plot keys can have multiple columns.
 * Error bars can have cross-ends.

 * Several user interface usability enhancements.

 * Embedding interface has been rewritten to be more robust. It now
   uses multiple processes and sockets.
 * Embedding now works fully on Windows.
 * Embedding interface has been expanded:
    - Zoom width, height and page options for zooming graph to window
    - Dynamically change update interval
    - Move between pages of documents
    - Open up more than one view onto a document

 * PDF export fixed for recent versions of Qt
 * Quite a lot of minor bug fixes
 
Features of package:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Line and function plots
 * Contour plots
 * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
