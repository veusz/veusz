Veusz Installation
==================

Veusz uses distutils for its installation. See below for how to use
it.

Requirements:
 python >= 2.3   http://www.python.org/
 PyQt >= 4.3     http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
 numpy >= 1.0    http://numpy.scipy.org/

(PyQt requires
 Qt4             http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/ (free version)
                 version >= 4.2.2 recommended
 SIP             http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/   )

Optional requirements:
 PyFITS>=1.1     http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits

 Veusz works much better with Microsoft's corefonts installed (or other good
 TrueType fonts). 
  see            http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/

Linux binary
============
If you do not have the requirements, you can use the Linux binary
instead. Note that this is not guaranteed to work due to glibc/library
incompatibilities. You need to simply unpack the tar file and run the
main executable:

# tar xzf veusz-linux-i386-1.0.tar.gz     [change version here]
# cd veusz-linux-i386-1.0
# ./veusz

Simple source use (if requirements installed)
=============================================
If you don't want to bother installing veusz fully, it can be run from
its own directory (at the moment). Simply do:

# tar xzf veusz-1.0.tar.gz                [change version here]
# cd veusz-1.0
# ./veusz_main.py

However certain features (currently contours) require C modules to be
built. Currently only contour support requires this. You can build
this without installing by doing:

# python setup.py build
# cp build/*/veusz/helpers/*.so helpers/

Installing/upgrading from rpm
=============================
(FIXME: no RPMS available yet)

For rpm based distributions, download the rpm for your distribution
(if it is available), and install as root:
# rpm -Uvh veusz-1.0-1.i386.rpm
(use correct name of rpm here)

If there is no rpm available for your distribution, download the source
rpm and rebuild
# rpmbuild --rebuild veusz-1.0-1.src.rpm
then install it from the location given when that command completes.
# rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/veusz-1.0-1.i386.rpm

If this doesn't work, see below for how to create an rpm from the source.
A "veusz" command is installed into your path to run the program.

Full installation with distutils
================================
There are a number of ways to install programs using distutils. I will
list a few of the possible method here:

To install to the standard location on the hard disk (it's better to use
rpms if you have an rpm-based linux distibution)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cd veusz-1.0
# python setup.py build
# su
[enter root password]
# python setup.py install 
# exit

To make an rpm from the distribution
------------------------------------
(FIXME: not checked for beta)

# cd veusz-1.0
# python setup.py bdist_rpm

An rpm should be generated in the dist subdirectory, so...

# su
[enter password]
# rpm -Uvh dist/veusz-*-1.noarch.rpm
# exit

A veusz script is installed into your default binary location, so run veusz
using the "veusz command"

Installing in Windows
=====================
Simply run the setup.exe binary installer.
Use control panel add/remove programs to remove.

For other ways of installing see http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html
