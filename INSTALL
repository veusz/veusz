Veusz Installation
==================

Veusz now uses distutils for its installation. See below for how to use
it. Note that the main veusz executable has changed from veusz.py
to veusz_main.py

Requirements:
 python 2.3      http://www.python.org/
 PyQt            http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
 Numarray        http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray

(PyQt requres
 QT              http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/
 SIP             http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/   )

Optional requirements:
 PyFITS>=0.9.8.2 http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits

 Veusz works much better with Microsoft's corefonts installed (or other good
 TrueType fonts). 
  see            http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/

Simple use
==========
If you don't want to bother installing veusz fully, it can be run from
its own directory (at the moment). Simply do:

# tar xzf veusz-0.10.tar.gz     [change version here]
# cd veusz-0.10
# ./veusz_main.py

However certain features (currently contours) require C modules to be
built. Currently only contour support requires this. You can build
this without installing by doing:

# python setup.py build
# cp build/*/veusz/helpers/*.so helpers/

Installing/upgrading from rpm
=============================
For rpm based distributions, download the rpm for your distribution
(if it is available), and install as root:
# rpm -Uvh veusz-0.10-1.i386.rpm
(use correct name of rpm here)

If there is no rpm available for your distribution, download the source
rpm and rebuild
# rpmbuild --rebuild veusz-0.10-1.src.rpm
then install it from the location given when that command completes.
# rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/veusz-0.10-1.i386.rpm

If this doesn't work, see below for how to create an rpm from the source.
A "veusz" command is installed into your path to run the program.

Full installation with distutils
================================
There are a number of ways to install programs using distutils. I will
list a few of the possible method here:

To make an rpm from the distribution
------------------------------------
# cd veusz-0.10
# python setup.py bdist_rpm

An rpm should be generated in the dist subdirectory, so...

# su
[enter password]
# rpm -Uvh dist/veusz-*-1.noarch.rpm
# exit

A veusz script is installed into your default binary location, so run veusz
using the "veusz command"

To install to the standard location on the hard disk (it's better to use
rpms if you have an rpm-based linux distibution)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cd veusz-0.10
# python setup.py build
# su
[enter root password]
# python setup.py install 
# exit

For other ways of installing see http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

Using FITS files
================
To enable FITS file data import, PyFITS must be installed in the
Python path. This can be accomplished by putting the pyfits.py file
into the standard Python install directory
(e.g. /usr/local/lib/python2.3), adding its directory into the
PYTHONPATH environment variable, or by copying the file into the main
Veusz directory.

I will also invesigate whether PyFITS can be distributed with Veusz.
